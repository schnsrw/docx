// Package room owns the lifecycle of every in-memory Y.Doc the
// gateway is currently serving.
//
// Lifecycle (per docs/05-backend-design.md):
//
//  1. First client for a docId triggers seed: load .docx from
//     WOPI, deserialize via the headless Bun pool, populate the
//     Y.Doc.
//  2. Subsequent clients sync-step against the in-memory Y.Doc.
//  3. Last client to disconnect triggers snapshot: serialize the
//     Y.Doc → .docx, PUT back to WOPI, drop the Room from the
//     manager so its memory is reclaimed.
//
// M1 scaffold: this file ships the manager + Room struct with
// thread-safe join/leave but without the WOPI seed/snapshot
// hooks. Those land in a follow-up commit alongside the WOPI
// client + protocol-driven update broadcasting.
