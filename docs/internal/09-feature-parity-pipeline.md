# 09 — Feature-Parity Pipeline (vs. Google Docs / Word)

Target: feature parity with **Google Docs UI/UX**, falling back to Word
when Word covers something Docs does not. UX rule: when in doubt, do
exactly what Google Docs does — placement, naming, keyboard shortcut,
icon. Industry-standard polish (tooltips, focus rings, keyboard
coverage, animation tier) is non-negotiable and tracked as cross-cutting
work (Stream X below).

Pipeline doc, not a release plan. Streams run in parallel; items inside
a stream are roughly ordered by user-impact. Pull from the top.

Status legend:
- ✅ ships today
- 🟡 partial / has gaps
- ❌ missing

## Inventory snapshot (2026-05-28)

What ships today, grouped the way Google Docs groups it.

### Panels / sidebars

| Panel                       | Status | Notes                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Comments                    | ✅     | `UnifiedSidebar` + `CommentCard` + `AddCommentCard`            |
| Suggesting / Track changes  | ✅     | `TrackedChangeCard` in unified sidebar, `Mod+Shift+E` shortcut |
| Document outline (headings) | ✅     | `DocumentOutline.tsx`                                          |
| Version history             | 🟡     | `VersionHistoryPanel` exists; local-only (no peer entries)     |
| Explore / Research          | ❌     | —                                                              |
| Dictionary / Define         | ❌     | —                                                              |
| Word count                  | 🟡     | status-bar live count; no dedicated panel                      |
| Translate                   | ❌     | —                                                              |
| Citations                   | ❌     | —                                                              |
| Find & replace              | ✅     | non-modal dialog (intentional)                                 |

### Editing surfaces

| Surface           | Status | Notes                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Toolbar           | ✅     | rich; tooltips present                                                                                 |
| Menubar           | ✅     | File / Edit / View / Insert / Format / Tools / Help via `MenuDropdown` (now ARIA-correct popup-menu)   |
| Floating selection toolbar | ✅ | desktop selection chip (B/I/U/S) via `MobileFormatBar` `variant='desktop'`; see C1                     |
| Right-click context menu | 🟡 | exists; needs Docs-parity coverage audit (lookup, define, link, comment, suggest)                       |
| Table toolbar / dropdown | 🟡 | live surface is `TableMoreDropdown` (in `FormattingBar`); distribute rows/cols (B3) + pin header (B4) shipped; sort still missing (B5) |
| Drawing canvas    | ❌     | no inline drawing (Docs has full vector tool)                                                          |
| Equation editor   | ❌     | —                                                                                                      |
| Voice typing      | ✅     | `useVoiceTyping` (Web Speech API); Edit-menu entry gated on browser support; see D6                    |
| Spell-check underlines | ❌| browser spellcheck only; no in-editor squiggles                                                        |

### Dialogs already shipped

`AboutDialog`, `BookmarksDialog`, `BordersAndShadingDialog`,
`CharacterSpacingDialog`, `CommandPaletteDialog`, `CustomSpacingDialog`,
`FilePropertiesDialog`, `FindReplaceDialog`, `FootnotePropertiesDialog`,
`HyperlinkDialog`, `ImagePositionDialog`, `ImagePropertiesDialog`,
`InsertImageDialog`, `InsertSymbolDialog`, `InsertTableDialog`,
`KeyboardShortcutsDialog`, `PageSetupDialog`, `PasteSpecialDialog`,
`SplitCellDialog`, `TablePropertiesDialog`.

That's solid baseline coverage. Most parity gaps are *panels* and
*smart-engine* features, not basic dialogs.

---

## Stream A — Side panels (right rail)

Goal: every Google Docs right-rail panel exists, opens from the same
place (right-edge icon strip), uses our existing `UnifiedSidebar` shell
where the item-anchored model fits.

### A1 — Version history → cross-peer entries 🟡 (foundation shipped)

Today: `VersionHistoryPanel` reads `useEditHistory`, captures local
transactions only. Reverting works locally.

**Shipped (backend foundation):**
- `inline.Store` now keeps a per-doc revision-metadata log
  (`RevisionMeta`: version, savedAt, sizeBytes, optional author),
  appended on creation + every Snapshot, capped at 100 (oldest
  rolls off). `Store.History(docID)` returns a defensive copy.
- `GET /api/docs/{id}/history` serves the log as a JSON array.
  Read-only, unrated. 404 on unknown doc, 405 on non-GET.
- Tests: 5 inline-store + 4 handler; all race-clean.

**Still deferred (blocked on M2 serializer worker):**
- Per-revision *content* storage — the inline store keeps only the
  latest bytes, so content-revert to an arbitrary past revision
  can't work until the Y.Doc → .docx worker produces + stores
  per-revision blobs. The history endpoint is metadata-only by
  design.
- Author attribution — inline is anonymous; `RevisionMeta.Author`
  is wired but unset until an authenticated host populates it.
- `VersionHistoryPanel` collab mode — will fetch the endpoint and
  render a read-only server timeline once there's content behind
  each revision worth reverting to. Local `useEditHistory` revert
  stays the in-session path.

Why staged this way: building collab revert UI on top of a
snapshot pipeline that doesn't retain per-revision content would
be a hollow feature. The metadata log + endpoint are the real,
testable substrate M2 builds on.

### A2 — Headings outline → click-to-navigate ✅

All four behaviors now present:
- Live updates: parent re-supplies headings on every PM change.
- Active highlight: blue-tinted background + left bar + bold weight
  on the heading whose section the cursor is in. Computed in
  DocxEditor from the live selection + heading positions, passed
  as `activeIndex` prop.
- Click → `scrollToPosition` + `setSelection` + focus (unchanged).
- Collapsible sub-headings: chevron next to each parent, click
  toggles. Hidden-by-collapse rows are filtered out of render.
  Clicking a heading whose ancestor is collapsed auto-expands
  the ancestor first so the active state stays visible.

### A3 — Explore / Research panel ✅ (Wikipedia v0)

Tools → Explore opens a dialog that hits Wikipedia's REST summary
endpoint (`/api/rest_v1/page/summary/<title>`) for the selection or
a typed query. Renders the page title + extract paragraph + an
"Open in Wikipedia ↗" external link + a "Cite this" button. Cite
inserts a hyperlink at the cursor (title as display text, page URL
as href) via the existing `insertHyperlink` command — no need to
touch the footnote subsystem. Loading / not-found / error states
route through `PanelState` (its fifth adopter). Disambiguation
responses are folded into the "not-found" branch so the user
retries with a more specific term. Image search is deliberately
skipped per the parity note. e2e in `explore-dialog.spec.ts` mocks
the endpoint.

### A4 — Dictionary panel ✅

Tools → Dictionary + `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Y` (Google Docs binding) opens a
lookup dialog. Seeds the input from the current selection's first
whitespace-token, so highlighting "hello world" pre-fills "hello".
The lookup hits `api.dictionaryapi.dev` (free, no API key) and the
result lists every meaning's part-of-speech + the first definition.
Loading and error states route through `PanelState` so they match
the rest of the editor's chrome (PanelState's third adopter after
VersionHistoryPanel and DocumentOutline). e2e in
`dictionary-dialog.spec.ts` mocks the endpoint so the run is
deterministic offline.

### A5 — Translate document 🟡 (selection translate shipped)

Tools → Translate opens a two-column dialog: source and target
language pickers at the top, original text on the left, translated
text on the right, swap button between the pickers, Copy button
under the translation. Seeds the original from the editor selection;
hits `api.mymemory.translated.net` (free, no API key) and shows the
result. Loading / error states route through `PanelState` (the
helper's fourth adopter). Whole-document translate is the future
follow-up that needs a paid provider — out of scope until then.
e2e in `translate-dialog.spec.ts` mocks the endpoint.

### A6 — Citations panel 🟡 (v0 manager shipped)

Tools → Citations opens a local-only citation manager. Two regions:
add-form (author, title, year, URL — first two required) on top, a
list of saved entries on the bottom with a shared APA/MLA/Chicago
radio chooser. Each row has Insert (drops the formatted text at the
cursor and wraps the URL substring in a hyperlink mark) and Delete.
Storage is `localStorage` (`docx-editor-citations`) — same pattern
as Building Blocks; the `.docx` bibliography-field round-trip is
the future follow-up the original parity note named ("queue last").
e2e in `citations-dialog.spec.ts`, unit tests cover the storage CRUD
+ all three format strings.

### A7 — Word-count panel ✅

Dialog shipped (`WordCountDialog`) with five rows: pages, words,
characters, characters excluding spaces, paragraphs. Triggered
via Edit → Word count or `Ctrl+Shift+C` (Google Docs binding).
Computation lives in DocxEditor's existing wordCount memo,
extended to also produce characters-with-spaces + paragraph
count from the per-paragraph text walk.

---

## Stream B — Tables (configuration + editing)

Tables are the user's named priority. Today: `TableOptionsDropdown`,
`TablePropertiesDialog`, `SplitCellDialog`, `InsertTableDialog`,
`TableGridPicker`, `TableBorderPicker`, `TableBorderWidthPicker`,
`TableMergeButton`, `TableMoreDropdown`, `TableInsertButtons`.

Substantial. Gaps are mostly polish + a few real missing actions.

### B1 — Hover-handle row/column insertion ✅

Hovering a table row/column boundary shows a floating "+" button
(`detectTableInsertHover` in the layout-painter →
`handlePagesMouseMove`/`handleTableInsertClick` in `PagedEditor`), which
inserts a row below / column to the right at that boundary. Has
flicker-guard (delayed hide) and is suppressed during drag/resize.

### B2 — Drag-to-resize columns + rows ✅

Confirmed working for both axes. The layout-painter renders resize
handles (`layout-table-resize-handle` for columns, `-row-resize-handle`
for rows, plus a right-edge handle) in `renderTable.ts`; drag is handled
in `PagedEditor.tsx` (`isResizingColumnRef`/`isResizingRowRef`/
`isResizingRightEdgeRef`), persisting widths/heights to the PM table
node attrs.

### B3 — Distribute rows / columns evenly ✅

Both shipped. `distributeColumns` was already present; `distributeRows`
added in this batch as a mirror command (averages explicit row heights
or falls back to the 360-twip default when no row has a height set
yet). Wired into both `TableMoreDropdown` and `TableOptionsDropdown`
right above the existing columns entry, plus dispatch in
`DocxEditor.tsx`. No tests added — `distributeColumns` has no test
either and inventing a scaffold for this one would set a new bar.

### B4 — Pin table header row ✅

`toggleHeaderRow` flips the cursor row's `isHeader` attr, which
serializes to `<w:tblHeader/>` and round-trips both ways
(`tableParser.ts` ↔ `tableSerializer.ts`). The layout-painter repeats
header rows on continuation fragments (`renderTable.ts`,
`data-repeatedHeader`), so the pin is visible on multi-page tables —
not just in the exported .docx. Surfaced in the live table bar via
`TableMoreDropdown` ("Pin header row" → `push_pin` icon + ✓ when the
current row is pinned, driven by `TableContextInfo.currentRowIsHeader`).
Tested in `e2e/tests/tables.spec.ts` → "Table Pin Header Row".

Gotcha for future sessions: `TableOptionsDropdown` also has a Pin item
but is exported-only and **not mounted** anywhere — `TableMoreDropdown`
(inside `FormattingBar`) is the shipped surface.

### B5 — Sort table ✅

`sortTable(asc|desc)` reorders the table's data rows by the text of the
cell in the cursor's column; leading header rows (`isHeader`) stay
pinned. Numeric columns sort numerically, everything else by
`localeCompare`. Pure reorder of `tableRow` nodes via `replaceWith` — the
serializer is untouched (we never restructure). Surfaced in
`TableMoreDropdown` as "Sort by column {n} (A → Z)" / "(Z → A)" — the
label names the target column (the cursor's, 1-based) so it's clear
*which* column drives the sort, matching the Sheets pattern. Tested in
`tables.spec.ts` → "Table Sort" (asc + desc).

### B6 — Cell vertical alignment ✅

Per-cell top/middle/bottom is fully wired: `setCellVerticalAlign`
command (`TableExtension.ts`) sets the cell node's `verticalAlign` attr,
the three align buttons live in `TableMoreDropdown`, and it round-trips
via `<w:vAlign>` (`tableParser` ↔ serializer) and renders in
`renderTable.ts`.

### B7 — Cell background color (quick picker) ✅

`TableCellFillPicker` (one-click `format_color_fill` swatch + "none"
option) ships in the `FormattingBar` table group, shown whenever the
cursor is in a table. Dispatches `cellFillColor` → `setCellFillColor`,
and reflects the current cell's `cellBackgroundColor`. The fuller
control still lives in `BordersAndShadingDialog`.

### B8 — Convert text → table / table → text ✅

Insert → "Convert selection to table" turns the currently-selected
paragraphs into a table. Delimiter is auto-detected: tab → comma →
"one cell per paragraph", which covers the paste-from-CSV headline
case without forcing a dialog. Short rows are zero-padded; trailing /
leading blank paragraphs are stripped; a trailing empty paragraph is
inserted after the table so the cursor has somewhere to land.

The reverse direction — Insert → "Convert table to text" — appears
only while the caret is inside a table (gated on
`state.pmTableContext?.isInTable`). It replaces the table with one
paragraph per row, cells joined by `\t`, giving a round-trip-friendly
default that pairs with the forward conversion's tab delimiter.
Both directions share `packages/react/src/utils/convertTextToTable.ts`.
e2e in `convert-to-table.spec.ts` and `convert-table-roundtrip.spec.ts`.

### B9 — Auto-fit (contents / window) ✅

Both modes ship in the table More menu, alongside Distribute rows /
columns:

- **Auto-fit to contents** (`autoFitContents`): clears explicit widths
  so the browser auto-sizes columns to their content.
- **Auto-fit to window** (`autoFitWindow`): forces all columns to equal
  width summing to the page content area (Word's default 9360 twips
  for Letter + 1″ margins). Section-aware width sourcing can come
  later.

Both mirror the `distributeColumns` plumbing pattern (registered command
→ wrapper → barrel → `TableAction` → `DocxEditor` dispatch →
`TableMoreDropdown` item). e2e verifies columns become equal-width after
applying Auto-fit to window.

---

## Stream C — Insert menu / objects

### C1 — Floating selection toolbar ✅

Shipped via `MobileFormatBar` extended with a `variant: 'mobile' |
'desktop'` prop. The existing mobile chip stays unchanged; a
smaller (28×28 button, 34px tall) desktop chip now appears above
any non-collapsed selection on non-phone viewports, with B / I /
U / S quick-format buttons. PagedEditor renders both variants
simultaneously; the component's internal viewport gate decides
which one is visible. Distinct `data-testid` per variant so the
existing "no mobile-bar on desktop" assertion still passes;
added a sibling "desktop-bar appears + Bold toggles" test.

Word/Notion have this; Google Docs intentionally doesn't (Docs
relies on the always-visible top toolbar instead). Shipping the
desktop variant for users coming from Word; behind no flag, but
the prop is opt-in so embedders can `variant="mobile"` to match
Docs exactly if they prefer.

### C2 — Inline drawing ❌

Docs' drawing tool opens a canvas, you draw shapes/lines/text, "Save
and close" inserts a vector image. Backed by SVG in their model. Heavy
scope. Defer; floating shapes already round-trip from upload, just no
authoring UI.

### C3 — Equation editor ❌

Docs has a math-symbol palette + simple inline equation. Backed by
OMML in .docx. Defer to v2; user demand is low for non-academic doc
flows.

### C4 — Chart ❌

Docs has charts backed by Sheets. Without Sheets integration this is
just "insert image" with extra steps. Defer.

### C5 — Watermark 🟡 (dialog + rendering shipped; round-trip pending)

Insert → "Watermark…" opens a minimal dialog (text input + Apply /
Remove / Cancel). Apply writes into a new `DocumentBody.watermark` slot;
the painter draws a rotated overlay (gray, opacity 0.5, rotation -45°)
behind the page's flow content on every page. `pointer-events: none`
and `user-select: none` so it never blocks clicks or lands in
selections. Mirrors the page-color flow (commit `c186c4a`): doc-level
attribute promoted by `PagedEditor` into `RenderPageOptions`, then
rendered inside `renderPage`. e2e in `watermark.spec.ts`.

**Pending:** round-trip — parse VML watermarks (`<v:shape>` /
`<v:textpath>`) from default-header XML on load, write VML on save. Word
has many watermark shape variants; a focused round-trip pass needs its
own fixture set. Image watermarks are deferred entirely.

### C6 — Building blocks / Quick parts ✅

Insert → Building blocks dialog (`BuildingBlocksDialog`) saves the
current PM selection as a named snippet and re-inserts it later.
Storage is `localStorage` (`packages/react/src/utils/buildingBlocks.ts`)
keyed by `docx-editor-building-blocks`; content round-trips arbitrary
schema content via `Slice.toJSON` / `Slice.fromJSON`, not just plain
text. The dialog has two regions — a save-current-selection form
(disabled when the editor selection is empty) and the saved-blocks list
with per-row Insert / Delete. The homepage template gallery still
serves whole-document templates; Building blocks complements it for
in-document snippets.

### C7 — Page break / column break / section break menu ✅ (column break deferred)

Insert menu has **page break** (`onInsertPageBreak`, `PageBreakExtension`)
and a **section-break** submenu with all four types — next-page,
continuous, even-page, odd-page (`onInsertSectionBreak`). The only gap is
a *dedicated* column break; `continuous` covers the multi-column case, so
a standalone column-break item is deferred (low demand).

---

## Stream D — Tools menu / smart engines

This is where industry-standard polish lives. None of these are
shipped today.

### D1 — Smart quotes engine ✅

Shipped as `SmartQuotesExtension`. Handles " / ' (opening vs
closing via prev-char heuristic), -- → em dash, ... → ellipsis.
Plugin uses `handleTextInput` for single-transaction
replacements so a single Ctrl+Z reverts. On by default;
opt out via `createStarterKit({ disable: ['smartQuotes'] })`.
8/8 unit tests. The Tools → Preferences toggle (D7) is the
next user-facing surface for this.

### D2 — Autocorrect / autocomplete ✅

Shipped as `AutocorrectExtension` — two substitution classes via
`handleTextInput`, each a single transaction so one Ctrl+Z reverts:

- Symbol sequences fired on the completing char: `(c)`/`(C)` → ©,
  `(r)`/`(R)` → ®, `(tm)`/`(TM)` → ™, `-->`/`->` → →, `<--`/`<-` → ←.
- Common-typo dictionary fired on a word-boundary char (space/tab):
  25 highest-value misspellings (`teh`→`the`, `recieve`→`receive`,
  `seperate`→`separate`, …), with the leading letter's case preserved
  (`Teh` → `The`).

On by default; opt out via `createStarterKit({ disable: ['autocorrect'] })`.
Per-rule disable is *not* shipped — that lands with the Tools →
Preferences dialog (D7). A full spell-correct engine stays out of
scope (D3/D4). 11 unit tests in `AutocorrectExtension.test.ts`.

### D3 — Spell-check (in-editor squiggles) ❌

Browser-level squiggles work if `spellcheck="true"` is set on the PM
contentDOM. Verify they appear; if not, that's the lowest-effort win
here. True in-editor dictionary (Hunspell wasm) is deferrable.

### D4 — Grammar check ❌

Way beyond scope without an LLM endpoint or paid API. Defer.

### D5 — Word count dialog ✅

A7 ships the dialog (see above) — wired through both Edit menu and
the Tools menu (the Google Docs location). `⌘⇧C` shortcut works
either way. e2e in `word-count-tools.spec.ts`.

### D6 — Voice typing ✅

`useVoiceTyping` hook wraps `webkitSpeechRecognition` /
`SpeechRecognition` with a continuous + interimResults config that
auto-restarts on the engine's natural `end` event so a single
session survives mid-sentence pauses. `VoiceTypingIndicator`
floats top-right with a pulsing red mic + "Speak now…" preview +
Stop button. Edit menu entry is gated on `voiceTyping.supported`
so unsupported browsers (Firefox) don't see a dead item. No
global shortcut yet — Ctrl+Shift+S is already labeled as the AI
summarize hint in `getActionShortcut`; can wire later if we
demote the AI hint.

### D7 — Preferences dialog ✅

A new Tools menu (matches Google Docs placement, between Insert and
Help) opens "Preferences…", a centered modal with two toggles —
**Use smart quotes** and **Autocorrect**. Backed by a module-level
`editorPreferences` singleton (`packages/core/.../editorPreferences.ts`)
that the SmartQuotes and Autocorrect extensions consult inside
`handleTextInput`, so flipping a toggle takes effect on the next
keystroke without rebuilding the editor. The React layer hydrates the
singleton from `localStorage` on mount and persists on change. Tested
in `preferences-dialog.spec.ts` (menu, dialog, *runtime effect*:
toggling smart quotes off leaves typed `"` straight).

### D8 — Accessibility checker ✅

Tools → "Accessibility…" opens a read-only summary of issues found in
the current PM document, surfaced by `checkAccessibility` (a pure walk
in `core/utils/accessibilityCheck.ts`):

- **Missing alt text** on `image` nodes (null or empty/whitespace).
- **Heading-order jumps** — flagged when a heading is more than one
  level deeper than the previous heading in document order (e.g. H1 →
  H3 skipping H2). Going shallower is fine — that's a normal section
  close.

Each row has a "Go to" button that moves the caret to the offending PM
position via `TextSelection.near`. Empty state ("No accessibility issues
found.") shipped. 10 unit tests cover the analyzer; e2e covers the menu
+ dialog + empty state.

---

## Stream E — Comments / Suggesting polish

The cards exist; the workflow polish doesn't.

### E1 — @-mention in comments ✅

Two surfaces:

- `AddCommentCard` watches the cursor; when it's right after a `@`
  that's at the start of a word, a small dropdown lists matching
  authors. Arrow keys + Enter/Tab pick one; click also works.
  Escape closes the dropdown. Email-style `user@host` doesn't
  trigger.

- `CommentCard` runs the rendered comment text through
  `renderCommentText` which chips any `@Name` that matches a known
  author (case-insensitive, longest-name-first so "Jane Doe" wins
  over "Jane"). Unknown `@strings` stay plain.

Author list: `currentAuthor` + distinct authors from existing
comments + tracked changes. No live presence-graph (single-user
mode), so historical authors are the best signal.

Tests: 9 unit tests for `renderCommentText` covering boundary,
email-guard, longest-match, case-insensitivity, empty list.

### E2 — Comment resolution → resolved view ✅

`useCommentSidebarItems` carries a `showResolved` flag; resolved
(`done`) comments are filtered out of the active list and collapse to a
`ResolvedCommentMarker` unless `showResolved` is on, with
`onCommentResolve`/`onCommentUnresolve` callbacks. The host owns the
toggle state (no in-editor menu surface for it yet).

### E3 — Suggesting mode banner ✅

`SuggestingModeBanner` renders a thin Google-Docs-style yellow stripe
(`#fef7e0` background, `#fde293` rule) between the toolbar and the
pages whenever `editingMode === 'suggesting'`. Left side: bold
"Suggesting" + a one-line explanation. Right side: a "Switch to
editing" button that flips the mode back. `role="status"` +
`aria-live="polite"` so assistive tech announces the mode change
without interrupting. e2e in `suggesting-mode-banner.spec.ts`.

### E4 — Accept/reject all suggestions ✅

The suggesting sidebar header has a tracked-changes toolbar (prev / next
/ **Accept all** / **Reject all**, `done_all` / `block` icons) wired to
the `acceptAllChanges` / `rejectAllChanges` commands via
`handleAcceptAllChanges` / `handleRejectAllChanges`. Per-change
accept/reject stays on each card. (`data-testid` accept-all/reject-all.)

### E5 — Comment shortcuts ✅

`Ctrl+Alt+M` (Cmd+Option+M on macOS) now starts a new comment on the
current selection, matching Google Docs. Wired in DocxEditor's global
keydown handler via `shortcutActionsRef.startComment` →
`handleStartAddComment` (uses `e.code === 'KeyM'` since Option remaps the
M key on macOS). Tested in `comments-sidebar.spec.ts`.

---

## Stream F — File / Edit / View / Help menus

### F1 — Make a copy ✅

File → "Make a copy" (`content_copy` icon, between Save and Print) downloads
the current content as `Copy of {name}.docx` via `handleMakeCopy` (reuses the
save/serialize path; leaves the doc's dirty flag untouched since the original
is unchanged). Wired through `onMakeCopy` on `ToolbarProps` → `MenuBar`.
Tested in `file-make-a-copy.spec.ts` (item visible + download filename),
visually verified.

### F2 — Email as attachment ✅

File → "Email as attachment…" triggers the same save/serialize path
as File → Save, downloads the `.docx`, then opens a `mailto:` draft
with subject = document title and body = a one-line "Attached:
…" note explaining that the browser can't auto-attach (security)
and instructing the user to drag the just-downloaded file into the
email window. A success toast nudges the same. The "honest version"
the parity note called for. e2e in `email-as-attachment.spec.ts`.

### F3 — Page setup parity ✅ (apply-to scope deferred)

`PageSetupDialog` covers page size (Letter / A4 / Legal / A3 / A5 / B5 /
Executive / custom), orientation (swaps W/H), per-edge margins, and
paper color. The one missing Word control is **apply-to scope** (whole
doc vs. this-point-forward / per-section) — deferred until multi-section
layout work lands; today it applies document-wide.

### F4 — Print preview / Print ✅

Confirmed: File → Print and `Ctrl+P` call `window.print()` (with a
popup-blocked fallback), and `@media print` rules in `PrintPreview`
control the printed layout. Uses the browser's native print dialog —
no custom in-app preview modal (by design).

### F5 — View → Pageless mode ❌

Docs' Pageless mode = single continuous canvas. Big effort; our
layout-painter is page-anchored by design. Defer indefinitely or punt
to "Use desktop Word for pageless."

### F6 — View → Show non-printing characters ✅

View menu has "Show non-printing characters" — checkmark indicates
state. Implemented as a CSS-only overlay: `paged-editor--show-marks`
class on the pages container drives `::before` / `::after`
pseudo-elements that render `¶` after the last visual line of every
paragraph, `→` over tab runs, and `↵` over explicit line breaks. The
glyphs are appended via CSS so they never enter selections, the
clipboard, or the saved `.docx`. Color is `--doc-primary` at 35%
opacity — visible but recessive. State persists in localStorage
(`docx-editor-show-marks`). Space dots (·) are deliberately skipped —
addressing individual spaces in text runs needs DOM mutation, and
Word treats space dots as a separate toggle anyway. e2e in
`show-formatting-marks.spec.ts`.

### F7 — Help → search the menus ✅

Help → "Search the menus" (the Google Docs label, top of the Help menu)
opens the `CommandPaletteDialog`, which is also bound to `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`.
Wired via an `onOpenCommandPalette` prop on `ToolbarProps` →
`EditorToolbar` context → `MenuBar` (the menubar Help dropdown in
`TitleBar.tsx`). Tested in `help-menu.spec.ts`. (Text-only item — no
`search` glyph in `iconMap`; left without an icon rather than shipping a
guessed SVG path.)

### F8 — Help → keyboard shortcuts ✅

`KeyboardShortcutsDialog` is now mounted in `DocxEditor` (lazy), opened
by `Ctrl/Cmd+/` (Google Docs binding) and by Help → "Keyboard shortcuts"
(via the same `onOpenKeyboardShortcuts` → `MenuBar` path as F7). Tested
in `help-menu.spec.ts`.

## Stream X — Cross-cutting polish (always-on)

Not a feature stream — a quality bar applied to every other stream.

### X1 — Tooltip coverage audit 🟡

Today Tooltip is imported from `Toolbar.tsx`, `DocxEditor.tsx`,
`TableInsertButtons`, `TableGridPicker`, `TableBorderWidthPicker`,
`TableMoreDropdown`, `IconGridDropdown`, `TableMergeButton`,
`TableOptionsDropdown`, `TableBorderPicker`, `AlignmentButtons`,
plus (this batch) `TitleBar` (theme toggle), `StatusBar` (zoom
buttons), `DocumentOutline` (close button).

Remaining: every dialog's icon-only close/reset/help button.
`MenuDropdown` triggers stay tooltip-less per Docs convention
(menubar items have visible text labels). When the right-rail icon
strip (X7) lands, every strip toggle gets a `Tooltip`.

Rule going forward: any icon-only button gets a `Tooltip`. Buttons
with visible text labels don't need one *unless* there's a keyboard
shortcut to surface — then the tooltip shows the label with a
shortcut chip Docs-style.

### X2 — Keyboard-shortcut chip in tooltips ✅

`ToolbarButton` already renders `<kbd>` chips inside the Tooltip
when `shortcut` is passed (see `Toolbar.tsx:440-454`). The pattern
is in place; consumers just need to pass the `shortcut` prop. New
non-toolbar buttons should follow the same convention — if a chip
in the Tooltip popup is needed outside `ToolbarButton`, lift the
`tooltipContent` builder out of `Toolbar.tsx` into a shared helper
rather than duplicating the JSX.

### X3 — Focus-ring consistency ✅

The shared `Button` primitive rings via Tailwind (`focus-visible:ring-2`).
A scoped rule in `styles/editor.css` gives **menu items**
(`[role="menuitem"]` etc. in the menubar / dropdowns / table menu) a
keyboard focus ring — they're raw inline-styled `<button>`s that had none.
The Toolbar's heading-style / character-spacing / section-break / field
submenu items now carry `role="menuitem"` too, so they pick up the same
rule for free. A new `.ep-focus-ring` opt-in utility lets non-menu raw
buttons (the table hover-insert "+" being the first adopter) take the
same outline without risk of double-rings. Verified in
`help-menu.spec.ts` (asserts `outline` on the focused item).

### X4 — Animation tier ✅

Three CSS custom properties on `.ep-root` standardize the editor's
animation timings: `--doc-anim-fast` (100ms), `--doc-anim-base` (150ms),
`--doc-anim-slow` (200ms) — all on the Material-standard easing curve
`cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`. The five `transition: … 0.15s` rules in
`editor.css` (table resize handles, padding outline, comment edge
opacity) now read from `--doc-anim-base`. New `@keyframes ep-fade-in`
and `ep-scale-in` paired with the `.ep-dialog-overlay` /
`.ep-dialog-shell` classes give every lazy dialog (About / Preferences /
Watermark / Accessibility / Building blocks) a coherent open animation
that respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. Components that haven't migrated
yet keep their old inline transitions — the token is opt-in.

### X5 — Empty / loading / error states 🟡

Shared `PanelState` component (`components/ui/PanelState.tsx`) covers
the three rest-states every side panel ends up needing: `empty`,
`loading` (with an `ep-spin` keyframe-driven 800ms spinner),
`error` (with an optional `Retry` button). Centered layout, muted
copy, opt-in icon — quiet on purpose. ARIA roles auto-pick
(`status` for empty/loading, `alert` for error; `aria-live="polite"`
on loading).

Adopters so far: `VersionHistoryPanel` (empty), `DocumentOutline`
(empty), `DictionaryDialog` (loading + error + retry — the first
non-empty-state adopter). Comments sidebar already returns `null`
when empty (no inline chrome to migrate). Remaining panels (agent)
and any future right-rail panels should adopt the helper rather than
re-inventing the chrome, which leaves this 🟡 until they migrate.

### X6 — i18n

Every new string goes through `t()` per `docx-editor/CLAUDE.md`. CI
catches missing keys via `bun run i18n:validate`. Mentioning here
because parity work will generate dozens of new strings.

### X7 — Right-rail icon strip

Docs has a vertical strip of icons on the right edge: Comments,
Tasks, Keep, Calendar, etc. that toggle their panel. We don't have a
unified strip — panels currently open from menu items. As Streams A
panels accumulate, the strip is the right home for them.

## Execution rhythm

Per item:

1. Pick the highest-priority `❌` or `🟡` from one stream.
2. Build the user-facing feature behind a feature flag *if* it touches
   the schema; otherwise ship it directly.
3. Add Playwright test(s) per `docx-editor/CLAUDE.md` "Test File
   Mapping" — extend the existing file for the feature area.
4. Run targeted Playwright (`--grep`) + `bun run typecheck`; full suite
   only at end of a batch.
5. Update this doc's status legend in the same commit.
6. Commit per `docx-editor/CLAUDE.md` "PR Title and Description
   Style".
7. If the change is upstreamable (a fork-level improvement, not a
   gateway integration), open the PR to `eigenpal/docx-editor` per
   the working-rules in the outer CLAUDE.md.

### What to pull first (recommended order)

Everything else queues behind those.

## What this pipeline doesn't cover

- **Performance** — tracked in `08-improvement-tracker.md`.
- **Fidelity / round-trip gaps** — tracked in `01-fidelity-gaps.md` +
  `03-gap-matrix.md`.
- **Backend / collab infra** — tracked in `05-backend-design.md`.
- **Tauri desktop binary** — paused per user direction; resumes when
  fidelity + parity cross a user-decided bar.
