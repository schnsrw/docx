# 09 — Feature-Parity Pipeline (vs. Google Docs / Word)

Target: feature parity with **Google Docs UI/UX**, falling back to Word
when Word covers something Docs does not. UX rule: when in doubt, do
exactly what Google Docs does — placement, naming, keyboard shortcut,
icon. Industry-standard polish (tooltips, focus rings, keyboard
coverage, animation tier) is non-negotiable and tracked as cross-cutting
work (Stream X below).

Pipeline doc, not a release plan. Streams run in parallel; items inside
a stream are roughly ordered by user-impact. Pull from the top.

Status legend:
- ✅ ships today
- 🟡 partial / has gaps

## Inventory snapshot (2026-05-28)

What ships today, grouped the way Google Docs groups it.

### Panels / sidebars

| Panel                       | Status | Notes                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Version history             | 🟡     | `VersionHistoryPanel` exists; local-only (no peer entries)     |
| Explore / Research          | ❌     | —                                                              |
| Dictionary / Define         | ❌     | —                                                              |
| Word count                  | 🟡     | status-bar live count; no dedicated panel                      |
| Translate                   | ❌     | —                                                              |
| Citations                   | ❌     | —                                                              |
| Find & replace              | ✅     | non-modal dialog (intentional)                                 |

### Editing surfaces

| Surface           | Status | Notes                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Toolbar           | ✅     | rich; tooltips present                                                                                 |
| Menubar           | ✅     | File / Edit / View / Insert / Format / Tools / Help via `MenuDropdown` (now ARIA-correct popup-menu)   |
| Floating selection toolbar | ❌ | Docs shows a mini toolbar on text-select; we have none                                                 |
| Right-click context menu | 🟡 | exists; needs Docs-parity coverage audit (lookup, define, link, comment, suggest)                       |
| Table toolbar / dropdown | 🟡 | `TableOptionsDropdown` etc.; missing "distribute rows/columns evenly", "pin header", sort              |
| Drawing canvas    | ❌     | no inline drawing (Docs has full vector tool)                                                          |
| Equation editor   | ❌     | —                                                                                                      |
| Voice typing      | ❌     | —                                                                                                      |
| Spell-check underlines | ❌| browser spellcheck only; no in-editor squiggles                                                        |

### Dialogs already shipped

`AboutDialog`, `BookmarksDialog`, `BordersAndShadingDialog`,
`CharacterSpacingDialog`, `CommandPaletteDialog`, `CustomSpacingDialog`,
`FilePropertiesDialog`, `FindReplaceDialog`, `FootnotePropertiesDialog`,
`HyperlinkDialog`, `ImagePositionDialog`, `ImagePropertiesDialog`,
`InsertImageDialog`, `InsertSymbolDialog`, `InsertTableDialog`,
`KeyboardShortcutsDialog`, `PageSetupDialog`, `PasteSpecialDialog`,
`SplitCellDialog`, `TablePropertiesDialog`.

That's solid baseline coverage. Most parity gaps are *panels* and
*smart-engine* features, not basic dialogs.

---

## Stream A — Side panels (right rail)

Goal: every Google Docs right-rail panel exists, opens from the same
place (right-edge icon strip), uses our existing `UnifiedSidebar` shell
where the item-anchored model fits.

### A1 — Version history → cross-peer entries 🟡

Today: `VersionHistoryPanel` reads `useEditHistory`, captures local
transactions only. Reverting works.

Gap: collab sessions need entries for *peer* edits, attributed to the
peer's presence name. Source of truth is the Yjs op-log on the backend;
the editor never sees the full peer stream as discrete edits.

Plan:
1. Backend snapshot worker writes per-revision metadata (author, ts,
   coalesced-edit-count, summary) alongside the .docx snapshot at room
   drain.
2. New `GET /api/docs/{id}/history` returns the metadata list.
3. `VersionHistoryPanel` gains a `mode: 'local' | 'collab'` prop; collab
   mode fetches from the gateway and falls back to local in offline
   mode.
4. Revert in collab mode = checkout-then-apply, not Yjs-undo (which only
   undoes your own ops).

### A2 — Headings outline → click-to-navigate ✅ refine

`DocumentOutline` exists. Verify it:
- Updates live as headings change.
- Highlights the heading whose section the cursor is in.
- Scrolls into view + selects on click.
- Collapses sub-headings (Docs-style chevrons).

If any of those four don't work, that's a P1 polish item.

### A3 — Explore / Research panel ❌

Google Docs' Explore panel surfaces web + image + drive results for the
current selection. For us, since we have no Drive/Workspace, a stripped
version:
- Selection text → DuckDuckGo (no API key) or Wikipedia REST.
- Image search → optional, defer.
- Cite-result button drops an inline footnote with the URL.

Defer if user demand is unclear.

### A4 — Dictionary panel ❌

Lightweight. Selection → free dictionary API (e.g. dictionaryapi.dev).
Two-line definition + part-of-speech. Shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+Y` per Docs.

### A5 — Translate document ❌

Whole-doc translate. Hard without a backend translation provider; cheap
v0 is "translate selection" via a free public endpoint, full-doc
deferred until a paid path exists.

### A6 — Citations panel ❌

Insert structured citation (APA / MLA / Chicago), maintain bibliography
section. Schema-level work — citations need to round-trip in .docx as
bibliography fields. Big scope; queue last.

### A7 — Word-count panel 🟡

Status bar shows live count. Docs also has a dialog (`Ctrl+Shift+C`)
that breaks down: words, characters, characters excluding spaces, pages.
Cheap to add — wrap the existing computation in a dialog component.

---

## Stream B — Tables (configuration + editing)

Tables are the user's named priority. Today: `TableOptionsDropdown`,
`TablePropertiesDialog`, `SplitCellDialog`, `InsertTableDialog`,
`TableGridPicker`, `TableBorderPicker`, `TableBorderWidthPicker`,
`TableMergeButton`, `TableMoreDropdown`, `TableInsertButtons`.

Substantial. Gaps are mostly polish + a few real missing actions.

### B1 — Hover-handle row/column insertion 🟡

Docs shows a `+` button on the row/column boundary when you hover the
table edge. Click inserts one before/after. Today: only via the menu /
dropdown. Adds discoverability.

### B2 — Drag-to-resize columns + rows ❓ verify

Verify it works smoothly (no flicker, snaps to min-width, respects %
widths). If broken or absent — P1.

### B3 — Distribute rows / columns evenly ❌

Two buttons in `TableMoreDropdown`: "Distribute rows" and "Distribute
columns". Word + Docs both have it. Schema already supports row heights
and column widths; this is pure command-layer work.

### B4 — Pin table header row ❌

Marks first row as `<w:tblHeader/>` so it repeats on every page in
print. Common ask; cheap implementation.

### B5 — Sort table ❌

Sort rows by selected column, ascending/descending. Docs has it; Word
has it (Layout → Sort). Pure JS sort over PM table-row nodes;
serializer is unchanged because we only reorder, never restructure.

### B6 — Cell vertical alignment ❓ verify

Verify `TablePropertiesDialog` covers top/middle/bottom vertical
alignment per cell. If only at table level — add per-cell control.

### B7 — Cell background color (quick picker) 🟡

Exists via `BordersAndShadingDialog`. Docs surfaces this as a one-click
color swatch in the table toolbar. Add a dedicated swatch button to
`TableOptionsDropdown`.

### B8 — Convert text → table / table → text ❌

Word feature; Docs partially. Useful for paste-from-CSV flows. Defer.

### B9 — Auto-fit (contents / window) ❌

Word feature. Sets column widths from cell contents or page width on
demand. Implementation involves layout-painter measuring rendered text.
Defer until a user actually asks.

---

## Stream C — Insert menu / objects

### C1 — Floating selection toolbar ❌

Docs shows a small popover above selected text: B / I / U / link /
comment / suggest. Reduces toolbar trips. Implementation: floating UI
positioned over the selection rect from the layout-painter's selection
overlay. Hide on selection-collapse.

### C2 — Inline drawing ❌

Docs' drawing tool opens a canvas, you draw shapes/lines/text, "Save
and close" inserts a vector image. Backed by SVG in their model. Heavy
scope. Defer; floating shapes already round-trip from upload, just no
authoring UI.

### C3 — Equation editor ❌

Docs has a math-symbol palette + simple inline equation. Backed by
OMML in .docx. Defer to v2; user demand is low for non-academic doc
flows.

### C4 — Chart ❌

Docs has charts backed by Sheets. Without Sheets integration this is
just "insert image" with extra steps. Defer.

### C5 — Watermark ❌

Word has it; Docs doesn't surface it well but supports import.
Schema-level work (header XML). Cheap to add: dialog → text/image →
write into all section headers.

### C6 — Building blocks / Quick parts ❌

Word feature; Docs equivalent is templates. We have a template gallery
on the homepage. Building-blocks-inside-the-document is deferrable.

### C7 — Page break / column break / section break menu 🟡

Verify Insert → Break covers page / column / section / next-page. If
any missing — easy fix.

---

## Stream D — Tools menu / smart engines

This is where industry-standard polish lives. None of these are
shipped today.

### D1 — Smart quotes engine ❌

`"hello"` → `"hello"`, `it's` → `it's`. Toggleable in Tools → Preferences.
Implementation: ProseMirror input rule. ~80 lines.

### D2 — Autocorrect / autocomplete ❌

`teh` → `the`, `(c)` → `©`, `--` → `—`. Same input-rule mechanism as
smart quotes. Maintain a small JSON dictionary; user can disable per
rule. Defer the full dictionary; ship the 20 highest-value rules first.

### D3 — Spell-check (in-editor squiggles) ❌

Browser-level squiggles work if `spellcheck="true"` is set on the PM
contentDOM. Verify they appear; if not, that's the lowest-effort win
here. True in-editor dictionary (Hunspell wasm) is deferrable.

### D4 — Grammar check ❌

Way beyond scope without an LLM endpoint or paid API. Defer.

### D5 — Word count dialog ❌

See A7. Belongs under Tools → Word count too.

### D6 — Voice typing ❌

`Ctrl+Shift+S` in Docs. Web Speech API. Cheap to add; quality is
browser-dependent.

### D7 — Preferences dialog ❌

Tools → Preferences in Docs lets users toggle autocorrect rules and
smart quotes. Needs a small settings store (localStorage is fine);
toggles plumb into the input-rule plugin.

### D8 — Accessibility checker ❌

Docs has Tools → Accessibility settings; surfaces missing alt text,
heading order issues. Defer; cross-cutting a11y work is already
covered in Stream X.

---

## Stream E — Comments / Suggesting polish

The cards exist; the workflow polish doesn't.

### E1 — @-mention in comments ❌

Type `@`, pick from presence list. No user-graph (single-user), so the
list is just current room peers. Cheap.

### E2 — Comment resolution → resolved view 🟡

Verify resolved comments are filterable / hidden by default, accessible
via a "Resolved comments" toggle. Docs UX.

### E3 — Suggesting mode banner ❌

When in suggesting mode, Docs shows a thin yellow banner at the top of
the doc. We have the Mode dropdown but no persistent banner. P2.

### E4 — Accept/reject all suggestions ❌

Toolbar buttons inside the suggestion card row are per-change. Add
"Accept all" / "Reject all" via the Tools menu or sidebar header.

### E5 — Comment shortcuts ❓ verify

`Ctrl+Alt+M` opens a new comment in Docs. Verify our binding.

---

## Stream F — File / Edit / View / Help menus

### F1 — Make a copy ❌

File → Make a copy. For us (no per-user account) = "download .docx with
filename `Copy of X.docx`". Cheap.

### F2 — Email as attachment ❌

`mailto:` link with subject = doc title, downloaded .docx attached.
Browser security blocks the attach; ship "Download + open mail" as the
honest version, or skip.

### F3 — Page setup parity ✅ verify

`PageSetupDialog` exists. Verify it covers: page size (Letter / A4 /
custom), orientation, margins, paper color (background), apply-to
(whole doc vs. this point forward).

### F4 — Print preview / Print ✅

Print handler fixed earlier this batch. Verify Print preview
specifically (Docs: `Ctrl+P` shows OS print dialog with our DOM).

### F5 — View → Pageless mode ❌

Docs' Pageless mode = single continuous canvas. Big effort; our
layout-painter is page-anchored by design. Defer indefinitely or punt
to "Use desktop Word for pageless."

### F6 — View → Show non-printing characters ❌

Toggle that shows paragraph marks, tabs, spaces. Word feature; useful
for advanced users. Add as a CSS class toggle on the layout-painter
output.

### F7 — Help → search the menus ❌

Docs has a `Ctrl+/` overlay that searches commands. We have
`CommandPaletteDialog`. Verify Help menu has an entry that opens it.

### F8 — Help → keyboard shortcuts ✅

`KeyboardShortcutsDialog` exists. Verify Help menu wires to it.

---

## Stream X — Cross-cutting polish (always-on)

Not a feature stream — a quality bar applied to every other stream.

### X1 — Tooltip coverage audit 🟡

Today Tooltip is imported from `Toolbar.tsx`, `DocxEditor.tsx`,
`TableInsertButtons`, `TableGridPicker`, `TableBorderWidthPicker`,
`TableMoreDropdown`, `IconGridDropdown`, `TableMergeButton`,
`TableOptionsDropdown`, `TableBorderPicker`, `AlignmentButtons`,
plus (this batch) `TitleBar` (theme toggle), `StatusBar` (zoom
buttons), `DocumentOutline` (close button).

Remaining: every dialog's icon-only close/reset/help button.
`MenuDropdown` triggers stay tooltip-less per Docs convention
(menubar items have visible text labels). When the right-rail icon
strip (X7) lands, every strip toggle gets a `Tooltip`.

Rule going forward: any icon-only button gets a `Tooltip`. Buttons
with visible text labels don't need one *unless* there's a keyboard
shortcut to surface — then the tooltip shows the label with a
shortcut chip Docs-style.

### X2 — Keyboard-shortcut chip in tooltips ✅

`ToolbarButton` already renders `<kbd>` chips inside the Tooltip
when `shortcut` is passed (see `Toolbar.tsx:440-454`). The pattern
is in place; consumers just need to pass the `shortcut` prop. New
non-toolbar buttons should follow the same convention — if a chip
in the Tooltip popup is needed outside `ToolbarButton`, lift the
`tooltipContent` builder out of `Toolbar.tsx` into a shared helper
rather than duplicating the JSX.

### X3 — Focus-ring consistency

Verify every interactive element shows a visible focus ring
(`:focus-visible`). The recent a11y batch covered tooltip focus
behavior; this is the visual sibling.

### X4 — Animation tier

Docs uses ~150ms ease-out for menu opens, ~100ms for tooltips. Audit
our timings — over-long animations feel laggy; under-long feels
jittery. Pick one easing token, apply everywhere.

### X5 — Empty / loading / error states

Each panel needs three states: empty (no content yet — friendly
hint), loading (spinner with skeletal layout), error (retry button).
`VersionHistoryPanel` already has `emptyHint` — generalize that
pattern.

### X6 — i18n

Every new string goes through `t()` per `docx-editor/CLAUDE.md`. CI
catches missing keys via `bun run i18n:validate`. Mentioning here
because parity work will generate dozens of new strings.

### X7 — Right-rail icon strip

Docs has a vertical strip of icons on the right edge: Comments,
Tasks, Keep, Calendar, etc. that toggle their panel. We don't have a
unified strip — panels currently open from menu items. As Streams A
panels accumulate, the strip is the right home for them.

---

## Execution rhythm

Per item:

1. Pick the highest-priority `❌` or `🟡` from one stream.
2. Build the user-facing feature behind a feature flag *if* it touches
   the schema; otherwise ship it directly.
3. Add Playwright test(s) per `docx-editor/CLAUDE.md` "Test File
   Mapping" — extend the existing file for the feature area.
4. Run targeted Playwright (`--grep`) + `bun run typecheck`; full suite
   only at end of a batch.
5. Update this doc's status legend in the same commit.
6. Commit per `docx-editor/CLAUDE.md` "PR Title and Description
   Style".
7. If the change is upstreamable (a fork-level improvement, not a
   gateway integration), open the PR to `eigenpal/docx-editor` per
   the working-rules in the outer CLAUDE.md.

### What to pull first (recommended order)

| Stream | Item                                                | Rationale                                                                               |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| X1     | Tooltip coverage audit                              | User explicitly named tooltips; pre-req for every other UI we ship.                     |
| B3     | Distribute rows / columns evenly                    | Highest-value table gap users hit daily.                                                |
| B4     | Pin table header row                                | Common docx ask; trivial XML attr.                                                      |
| C1     | Floating selection toolbar                          | Biggest single visible-polish win; signals "real editor."                               |
| D1     | Smart quotes                                        | Tiny effort, very visible (typing `"` produces curly quote).                            |
| A7     | Word-count dialog                                   | Quick win; status-bar plumbing already exists.                                          |
| A2     | Outline → click-to-navigate refinement              | Verify what's there; polish gaps that surface.                                          |
| E1     | @-mention in comments                               | Adds presence-aware feel without a user-graph.                                          |
| D6     | Voice typing                                        | Web Speech API; quick demo-friendly win.                                                |
| A1     | Version history → cross-peer entries                | Real-collab requirement; larger but unblocks "collab feels finished."                   |

Everything else queues behind those.

## What this pipeline doesn't cover

- **Performance** — tracked in `08-improvement-tracker.md`.
- **Fidelity / round-trip gaps** — tracked in `01-fidelity-gaps.md` +
  `03-gap-matrix.md`.
- **Backend / collab infra** — tracked in `05-backend-design.md`.
- **Tauri desktop binary** — paused per user direction; resumes when
  fidelity + parity cross a user-decided bar.
