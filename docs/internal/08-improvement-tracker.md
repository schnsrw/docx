# Casual Editor — Improvement Tracker

Single source of truth for outstanding doc-editor issues. Started 2026-05-25 from a four-axis audit (fidelity, UI/UX, collab/backend, code health). Mirrors the issue-list shape of [`03-gap-matrix.md`](./03-gap-matrix.md) but covers behavioural / UX / infra gaps, not just OOXML fidelity.

Every item has a citation. P0/P1/P2/P3 are severity. ⬜ pending · 🔵 in progress · ✅ shipped.

| ✅  | **#28** Inline-host eviction now logs a slog.Warn so silent data-loss surfaces                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `backend/internal/host/inline/inline.go`                                                         |
| 🟠  | **#41** Audit overstated unguarded console.log — most are debug-gated or public-API helpers (`printExplorationSummary`, MCP `debug: true`). Not a leak; closing without code change.                                                                                                       | n/a                                                                                              |
| 🟠  | **#29** Awareness exposure isn't a code gap — the existing `plugins` prop already lets consumers wire `yCursorPlugin` (see `examples/collaboration/`). Closing as a doc-only item; consider a guide page.                                                                                  | n/a                                                                                              |
| ✅  | **P0 #2** — Drawings / images / tables register as edits. `ParagraphChangeTrackerExtension` now tracks `changedBlockTypes` alongside paraIds; `tr.before` walked on deletions; selective-save falls back to full re-pack when a drawing was touched. 4 new unit tests, 801/801 suite pass. | `features/ParagraphChangeTrackerExtension.ts`, `DocxEditor.tsx`                                  |
| ✅  | **F3** — `FocusTrap` primitive shipped as opt-in. Sweep into 7+ existing dialogs is a follow-up.                                                                                                                                                                                           | `components/ui/FocusTrap.tsx`                                                                    |
| ✅  | **P1 #9** — Duplicate image IDs (template-engine docs). `getUniqueId` now treats string `"0"` as falsy, allocating a fresh auto-id per image so Word renders all of them. 4 regression tests.                                                                                              | `serializer/runSerializer.ts`                                                                    |
| ✅  | **P1 #7** — Font categories (`eastAsia` / `cs`) preserved through PM mark conversion. Two secondary conversion sites (`markUtils.textFormattingToMarks` + `ParagraphExtension` style-cascade) only forwarded `ascii` / `hAnsi` / `asciiTheme` — DengXian-style East Asian fonts round-tripped as Arial when inherited from a style. | `markUtils.ts`, `ParagraphExtension.ts`                                                          |
| ✅  | **P2 #36** — `htmlFor` / `id` pairing on PageSetup + TableProperties form fields. Stable id prefixes so e2e selectors stay deterministic. 805/805 unit + lint + format + typecheck clean.                                                                                                  | `PageSetupDialog.tsx`, `TablePropertiesDialog.tsx`                                               |
| ✅  | **P3 #45** — Status-bar word + char count now derives from `pmState.doc.descendants()` instead of `history.state.package.document`. Live-updates on every PM transaction (including undo / redo), not just on open / save / autosave.                                                       | `DocxEditor.tsx`                                                                                 |
| ✅  | **P3 #47** — `ImagePropertiesDialog` Enter no longer hijacks alt-text TEXTAREA newlines. Skip Enter-to-submit when target is TEXTAREA or BUTTON; Escape still always closes.                                                                                                                | `ImagePropertiesDialog.tsx`                                                                      |
| ✅  | **P3 #48** — Reply-thread 2-line clamp inconsistent across fonts. Switched fixed `lineHeight: 20px` → unitless `1.4` so clamp scales with font-size.                                                                                                                                       | `ReplyThread.tsx`                                                                                |
| ✅  | **P3 #44** — `MenuDropdown` hardcoded zIndex 9998 / 9999 / 10001 → `Z_INDEX.menubarBackdrop` / `Panel` / `Trigger` constants in the shared stacking module. Single source of truth instead of magic numbers.                                                                                | `MenuDropdown.tsx`, `styles/zIndex.ts`                                                           |
| ✅  | **P3 #50** — `auto + themeColor` was dropped at two secondary PM-conversion sites (`markUtils.textFormattingToMarks` style-cascade + `ParagraphExtension` style-resolver). Main `toProseDoc` path was already fixed; now all three forward `auto` field + use the same gate. Stale "THIS IS THE BUG" comment cleared. | `markUtils.ts`, `ParagraphExtension.ts`, `theme-color-roundtrip.test.ts`                          |
| ✅  | **P2 #35** — `CommentCard` three-dot menu is now keyboard-accessible: Escape closes + returns focus to trigger; first menu item auto-focuses on open; click-outside closes. Plus `role="menu"` / `role="menuitem"` semantics.                                                              | `CommentCard.tsx`                                                                                |
| ✅  | **P2 #38** — Dialog 20 px margin tightened to `clamp(8px, 2.5vw, 20px)` so dialogs don't kiss the viewport edge on 320 px-and-narrower phones. Swept across all 10 modal dialogs. FindReplace preserves its longhand top-offset.                                                            | dialogs/\*.tsx (10 files)                                                                        |
| ✅  | **P2 #19** — Formatting now persists across full-paragraph delete + retype. New `StoredMarksRestoreExtension` re-hydrates `state.storedMarks` from a paragraph's `defaultTextFormatting` attr whenever the cursor lands in an empty paragraph and PM has cleared storedMarks. 4 `fixme`'d e2e tests un-skipped; 7-test unit suite for the plugin state machine. | `features/StoredMarksRestoreExtension.ts` (new), `StarterKit.ts`, `formatting-persistence.spec.ts` |
| ✅  | **P2 #24** — Multi-select list toggle + outdent tests un-fixme'd. The fix has been in `ListExtension.toggleList` / `decreaseListLevel` for a while (both walk `nodesBetween($from.pos, $to.pos)`); the `.fixme` tags were masking working behavior, so CI didn't validate them. Ran all 3 tests locally → 3/3 passed. | `e2e/tests/list-multi-toggle.spec.ts`, `list-multi-indent.spec.ts`                                  |
| ✅  | **P2 #20** — Toolbar correctly reports formatting at cursor boundaries. `extractSelectionState` was using PM's left-leaning `$from.marks()` only, so cursor at start of a bold word read bold-inactive (LEFT = plain space). Now: collapsed cursor uses `cursorBoundaryMarks` (union of `nodeBefore.marks ∪ nodeAfter.marks` deduped by type+attrs), non-empty selection uses `selectionRangeMarks` (intersection across the range so half-bold/half-plain reads inactive — Word parity). Storedmarks still take precedence so typing semantics stay LEFT-leaning. 6 new unit tests in `markUtils.test.ts`; e2e `cursor at start of bold word` un-fixme'd. Note: the union fix already lived in `selectionTracker.ts` but the toolbar path goes through `selectionState.ts` — that was the missed site. | `selectionState.ts`, `markUtils.ts`, `toolbar-state.spec.ts`                                       |
| ✅  | **P2 #25 / #26 / #27** — Backend Go cleanup batch. (1) Join↔Leave race fixed: `Manager.Join` now holds `m.mu` through `AddClient` so a concurrent Leave can't observe `Clients()==0` between Join's release and AddClient, drain the room, and orphan the new client on a dead Room. Stress test paired Join/Leave 200× in parallel and asserts `Count()==0` (passes under `-race`). (2) Dropped broadcast frames now emit an `slog.Warn` on power-of-two crossings (1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th, … drop per client) with `doc`+`client`+`dropsTotal` keys — operator gets a falling-behind signal without one chronic slow client flooding logs. (3) Gateway's `host.Fetch` preflight now logs the underlying error before returning 502 — previously the only signal was a generic `host integration error` response, so transient host failures left no trace. | `backend/internal/room/manager.go`, `manager_test.go`, `backend/cmd/gateway/main.go` |
| 🟠  | **P3 #46** — Audited: `MobileFormatBar` already uses `aria-label={b.label}` with unique per-button labels (Bold/Italic/Underline/Strikethrough). Tracker entry was stale; no fix needed.                                                                                                                                                  | n/a                                                                                              |
| ✅  | **P3 #40 (3/3)** — All three live `// TODO` markers resolved. (1) `agent/context.ts:193` `inTable` → design note (was misleadingly marked as a stub; `paragraphs` filters `body.content` to top-level blocks, so `inTable = false` is correct for the current addressing scheme). (2) `footnoteLayout.ts:36` → implemented: footnotes now resolve `FootnoteText` / `footnote text` style fontSize via the existing `StyleResolver` before falling back to the 8pt baseline. New `resolveFootnoteFontSizePt` helper + `applyFootnotePresentation` takes an optional `defaultFontSizePt`. 9-test unit suite covers the cascade and fallback paths. (3) `manager.go:200` → milestone-reference note (M2 host-integration seed, tracked under P0 #1 / P1 #6 / F4). | `agent/context.ts`, `layout-bridge/footnoteLayout.ts`, `footnoteLayout.test.ts` (new), `backend/internal/room/manager.go` |
| ✅  | **P2 #32** — Cmd+K hyperlink dialog. Un-fixme'd; 3/3 stable local runs + full 10/10 hyperlinks.spec pass. The original concern about Playwright not delivering Ctrl/Cmd+K reliably was either flake-on-old-Chromium or fixed by an upstream patch — the harness routes the keystroke through PM correctly now. |
| ✅  | **P3 #43** — `demo-docx.spec.ts:596` `test.fixme` deleted instead of un-fixme'd. The body was a verbatim duplicate of the preceding 'should allow editing after load' smoke (focus → type → assert visible) with no save/reload assertion; un-skipping would have added zero coverage. Inline note marks the slot for a real round-trip test when save+reload infrastructure lands. | `e2e/tests/demo-docx.spec.ts`, `e2e/tests/hyperlinks.spec.ts`                                       |
| 🟠  | **P3 #49** — ProseMirror pin audit (2026-05-25). `prosemirror-view@1.41.8`, `prosemirror-state@1.4.4`, `prosemirror-transform@1.12.0` are all at npm-latest. `prosemirror-model@1.25.4` is 3 patches behind (1.25.5/6/7), but all three were published within the past 10 days (2026-05-14 → 2026-05-18) — too fresh for community vetting on a core dep that touches every keystroke. No specific bug driving the upgrade. **Re-audit ≥ 2026-06-15** (one-month settling window) and bump model unless a regression has surfaced. | `package.json`                                                                                    |
| ✅  | **P1 #8** — Footer field codes (`PAGE`, `NUMPAGES`) round-trip correctly. The tracker entry claimed they exported as literal text; an end-to-end round-trip test (parse → `headerFooterToProseDoc` → `proseDocToBlocks` → `serializeHeaderFooter`) shows the field structure survives. 5 new tests pin both `<w:fldChar>+<w:instrText>` complex fields and `<w:fldSimple>` single-element forms — both produce a valid complex-field tripod on output and never leak `{PAGE}` / `{NUMPAGES}` literal text. Closes the bug as audit-clean and locks in anti-regression. | `__tests__/footer-field-roundtrip.test.ts` (new)                                                  |
| ✅  | **P2 #34 (13/13)** — FocusTrap sweep complete. Wired into all 13 aria-modal dialogs: HyperlinkDialog, PageSetupDialog, ImagePositionDialog, ImagePropertiesDialog, SplitCellDialog, TablePropertiesDialog, KeyboardShortcutsDialog, PasteSpecialDialog, InsertTableDialog, InsertImageDialog, InsertSymbolDialog, FilePropertiesDialog, CommandPaletteDialog. FocusTrap's wrapper uses `display: contents` so it doesn't break parent flex centering. CommandPaletteDialog uses `initialFocus={inputRef}` so the search input focuses on mount; the rest auto-focus the first focusable. Final 7 dialogs were wrapped manually (a previous scripted attempt matched a helper function's `return (` and broke PasteSpecialDialog). | `FocusTrap.tsx`, 13 dialogs                                                                       |

Needs a Bun worker pool that takes Y.Doc state → fresh `.docx` bytes. Until then, real-time edits are lost when the last client disconnects. |
| ✅  | 2   | **Drawings / textboxes bypass change tracker** — _now fixed_ (see "Recently shipped"). Diagnosis was off: y-prosemirror does sync drawings (no schema filter); the gap was in `ParagraphChangeTracker`'s paragraph-only walk, which left selective-save with an empty paraId set on drawing-only transactions. | `features/ParagraphChangeTrackerExtension.ts` |

## Feature work (planned, not bugs)

### F1 — Version-history side panel (Sheets parity)

**Status:** scaffolding starts this session.
**Why:** Sheets ships a `HistoryPanel` + `useLocalHistory` hook that captures every committed mutation, surfaces a timestamp + author feed in a side rail, and offers one-click revert. Casual Editor has no equivalent — users have undo/redo only.

**Design:**

- **Capture:** subscribe to ProseMirror `Transaction`s via a plugin that watches `tr.docChanged`. For each `tr`, snapshot `tr.before.toJSON()` for the revert path + record `{ steps, author, timestamp }`. In collab mode, prefer Y.Doc `update` events so peer-originated changes also land in the feed.
- **Storage:** IndexedDB ring buffer of 500 entries (matches Sheets' `RING_CAP`). Per-doc keyed by file id; survives reload in single-user mode.
- **UI:** new `VersionHistoryPanel` in `packages/react/src/components/sidebar/`. Render in the panel rail next to comments / track-changes. Show timestamp, author name (from presence), summary ("3 paragraphs", "image inserted"), revert button.
- **Revert:** dispatch `tr` rebuilt from stored `before` snapshot, or apply the diff between then and now via PM's `Mappable` interface.
- **Collab caveat:** revert across peers is destructive — gate behind a confirmation dialog.

**Risks:**

- Snapshotting `tr.before` doubles memory for large docs. Mitigate with size cap.
- Drawings + textboxes don't currently sync (P0 #2) — so reverting will lose them silently until that's fixed.

**Estimate:** L (1-2 sessions).

### F2 — Awareness exposure through `<DocxEditor>` (closes #29)

Wrap `yCursorPlugin` as an optional prop on the main component so consumers don't have to wire it themselves.

### F3 — Shared `FocusTrap` for dialogs (closes #34)

Build one helper component, apply to every dialog. Trap Tab/Shift+Tab inside the modal.

### F4 — Y.Doc → `.docx` serializer worker pool (closes P0 #1, P1 #6)

Multi-week M2 effort. Design pending.

## Phase 1.5 — Doc-user feature audit (2026-05-26)

**Findings** (full audit in this session): the architecture is sound — parser + serializer + PM schema cover ~90% of canonical Word features. The big gap is **UI affordances for already-supported data-model features**. A user with Word/Docs muscle memory tries to format something we technically parse correctly and finds no button to drive it.

Three buckets, ordered by effort:

### Bucket A — UI for already-implemented data-model features (mechanical, 1-2 sessions each)

Each of these has working parser + serializer + PM schema. They just need a toolbar control / dialog / menu entry / keyboard shortcut.

| ID  | Feature                              | Where the data lives                                  | UX target                                                                          |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| U1  | Character spacing slider/dialog      | `CharacterSpacingExtension` + `formatting.spacing`    | Format menu → Character spacing dialog (expand / condense)                         |
| ✅ U2 | Small caps / All caps toggle buttons | `SmallCapsExtension`, `AllCapsExtension`              | **Done.** New toolbar toggles after strikethrough; `aria-pressed` flips on click. Also closed a real bug — `selectionState.ts` was missing `smallCaps` / `allCaps` cases (the same toolbar-read path P2 #20 fixed), so the menu-driven entries were also reading as inactive even when the mark was applied. |
| ✅ U3 | Text effects buttons                 | `EmbossExtension`, `ImprintExtension`, `TextShadowExtension`, `TextOutlineExtension` | **Done.** Format menu → "Text effects" submenu with Emboss / Imprint / Outline / Shadow rows. Each row shows a checkmark for active state. New `toggleEmboss` / `toggleImprint` / `toggleTextShadow` / `toggleTextOutline` commands. Mark extraction added to both `selectionState.ts` and `selectionTracker.ts`. 6 new unit tests (one per command, a coexist test, and a schema-missing safety test). |
| ✅ U4 | Hidden text toggle                   | `HiddenExtension`                                     | **Done.** New Format menu entry under Small/All Caps with checkmark for active state. `toggleHidden` command added next to `toggleSmallCaps`/`toggleAllCaps`. `SelectionFormatting.hidden` extracted in both `selectionState.ts` (toolbar path) and `selectionTracker.ts` (plugin path). 8-test unit suite for the command. |
| U5  | Paragraph indent dialog              | `indentLeft` / `indentRight` / `indentFirstLine` / `hangingIndent` parse + serialize | Format → Paragraph dialog (Word's full paragraph dialog)                           |
| U6  | Paragraph borders + shading          | Parsed in `paragraphParser`; no PM schema yet         | Format → Borders & Shading dialog                                                  |
| ✅ U7 | Regex toggle in Find                 | `FindReplaceDialog` schema has `useRegex` flag        | **Done.** New "Regular expression" checkbox alongside Match case / Whole words. Threaded through `onFind` + `onReplaceAll`. Closed a real bug too — `findAllMatches` ignored `options.useRegex` (always escaped) and also incorrectly lowercased the search string (corrupting regex tokens like `\D` → `\d`). Now: useRegex respected + case-folding driven by regex flags only. 11-test unit suite (`findReplaceUtils.test.ts`) covers literal vs regex semantics, invalid-regex safety, and composition with matchCase / matchWholeWord. |
| U8  | Restart numbering                    | List `numPr` + `numbering.xml`                        | List context menu → Restart numbering (or right-click on bullet)                   |
| ✅ U9 | Insert section break                 | `insertSectionBreak` command exists                   | **Done.** Insert menu (both Toolbar dropdown + TitleBar MenuBar) now has a "Section break" submenu with Next page / Continuous / Even page / Odd page. Wrapped the existing `insertSectionBreak(breakType)` command in `handleInsertSectionBreak` + new `onInsertSectionBreak` prop on Toolbar — threaded through EditorToolbarContext so the TitleBar entry stays in sync. |
| U10 | Columns layout                       | layout-engine + section props support columns         | Page Layout menu → Columns (1 / 2 / 3 / More …)                                    |
| U11 | Banded rows toggle                   | Table style props parsed                              | Table Design tab → "Banded rows" checkbox                                          |
| ✅ U12 | PAGE / NUMPAGES field insert         | Field nodes + serializer work end-to-end (P1 #8)      | **Done.** Insert menu (both Toolbar dropdown + TitleBar MenuBar) → "Field" submenu with 8 entries: Page number / Total pages / Date / Time / Created date / Last saved / Author / File name. New `insertField(fieldType, instruction?)` command lives in commands/field.ts. Builds a complexField PM node with the canonical Word instruction (` PAGE `, ` NUMPAGES `, etc.). 6-test unit suite covers each fieldType, custom instruction override, schema-missing safety, and edge selection. |
| U13 | Math equation insert                 | `MathExtension` parses OMath                          | Insert menu → Equation (KaTeX-style inline editor)                                 |
| U14 | Bookmarks management                 | `bookmarkParser.ts` reads/writes                      | Insert menu → Bookmark dialog (add / go to / delete)                               |
| U15 | Header/Footer first-page + even-odd  | Section properties parsed                             | Header/footer toolbar → "Different first page" + "Different odd & even" checkboxes |

### Bucket B — Features missing entirely (parser + UI both needed)

These are doc-user expectations the codebase doesn't address at all. Each is a multi-session feature.

| ID  | Feature                          | Notes                                                                                                                   |

| M2  | Recent files                     | Sheet-style local-history list on the home screen.                                                                      |

| M5  | Image crop                       | Resize works; crop doesn't.                                                                                             |
| M6  | Cross-references                 | Insert reference to a heading / figure / table number. Different from hyperlinks.                                       |
| M7  | Update TOC                       | TOC insertion exists; refreshing after content changes does not.                                                        |
| M8  | Spell-check (proper)             | Currently only the browser-native squiggle. No "ignore once" / "add to dictionary" / language picker.                   |
| M9  | Language dropdown                | Document-level + paragraph-level language tag (`w:lang`).                                                               |
| M10 | Mention (@user) in comments      | Comment infrastructure exists; @-trigger autocomplete + permission-aware mention doesn't.                               |
| M11 | Name a version / compare         | F1 captures entries; can't label or diff two of them.                                                                   |
| M12 | Presence cursors + awareness     | Y.Doc collab plumbing exists in backend; client doesn't render peer cursors / names.                                    |
| M13 | Outline collapse / expand        | DocumentOutline lists headings; can't fold sections in the editor body.                                                 |
| M14 | Pinch-zoom (touch)               | StatusBar has zoom +/-; no touch pinch.                                                                                 |
| M15 | Long-press context menu (mobile) | Desktop right-click works; mobile long-press doesn't.                                                                   |

### Bucket C — Accessibility / industry-standard UX hardening

Smaller items that round off the polish bar. Most are 1-day fixes.

| ID  | Issue                                | Notes                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A1  | `prefers-reduced-motion` not honored | WCAG 2.1 SC 2.3.3. Wrap animations/transitions in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`.                            |
| A2  | ARIA-live regions for status updates | Track-changes accept/reject, comment resolve, autosave should announce via `role="status" aria-live="polite"`.          |
| A3  | Keyboard shortcut coverage gaps      | Audit + document every menu action's shortcut. Word/Docs parity is the bar.                                             |
| A4  | Dialog focus-restore on close        | FocusTrap restores focus inside the dialog, but the trigger element should regain focus on close — already done for some dialogs, not all.   |
| A5  | Nested menu touch targets            | Toolbar buttons ≥44px on mobile (done); audit dropdown items + context menu rows on touch.                              |

### Triage rule

Bucket A items ship one-per-session as long as Phase 1 stability work doesn't pre-empt them. Bucket B items wait until Bucket A is mostly drained — they're heavier and overlap with Phase 2 polish work. Bucket C runs in parallel with whichever is active.

## Phase 2 — Deployable-product features (deferred until phase 1 stabilizes)

**Scope decision (2026-05-26):** doc repo focuses on stabilizing co-editing, single-doc editing, and editor UX first. The list below is the next bucket — port the equivalent features from the sheet repo (which has all of them shipped and exercised) once phase 1 is solid. Each item references its sheet-side counterpart so the port is bounded.

Don't open these until the P0/P1 stability work is closed; a polished admin UI on top of an editor that corrupts on save is wasted effort.

### F5 — Storage backends (memory / local / s3 / postgres)

Implement `host.Integration` (interface already exists in `backend/internal/host/host.go`) for non-inline backends. Sheet model: `apps/server/src/host/integration.ts` + storage section in admin UI.

### F6 — JWT auth + roles + permissions

Anonymous-by-room is fine for the demo; production needs auth. Sheet model: `apps/server/src/auth/jwt.ts` + `auth/types.ts` (HS256, role/permissions/features claims).

### F7 — WOPI client (Nextcloud / SharePoint / Collabora targets)

The `host.go` interface already has `wopi` and `jwtapi` placeholder comments. Sheet model: `apps/server/src/wopi.ts` + unit tests.

### F8 — Admin panel UI

Auth / Branding / Storage / Networking / Limits / Webhooks / BasePath sections. Sheet model: `apps/web/src/admin/` SPA — port section files near-verbatim once the server-side config endpoints (F5/F6) exist.

### F9 — Webhooks

Save / load / drain events fired to configured webhook URLs. Sheet model: `apps/server/src/admin/webhooks.ts`.

### F10 — Branding / white-label runtime config

Reads from admin config (F8), themes the chrome (logo, colors, app name). Sheet model: `BrandingSection.tsx` + the chrome reading `--brand-*` CSS vars from the admin config. Doc currently has only static brand colors in the demo `Home.tsx`.

## Triage rules

- **P0 ships next.** Then P1 in audit order unless a P2 is a daily annoyance.
- Every fix lands with a regression test (e2e for UI, unit for logic).
- `test.fixme` is a contract: turn green or remove the bait.
- If a fix has been reverted twice (#5), require a design doc before attempt 3.
- Tracker entries flip ⬜ → ✅ in the same commit that ships the fix; never let the doc drift from reality.
